#### Control Application
One of three functionalities of the entire application. In this view an
instructor is presented with slider bars to control and change the simulated
patient's vitals.

#### Dummy
The fake torso that a participant iteracts directly with. An instructor observes
this interaction and may affect the simulation through the control application.

#### Face Monitor
One of three functionalities of the entire application. In this view a
participant is presented with the simulated patient's face. There is no direct
controls in this view; all updates are recieved remotely from the control
application.

#### Instructor
The person who uses the control application to control the parameters of the
simulation.

#### Participant
The person who affects the simulation through the instructor and observes the
simulation through the face monitor and vitals monitor.

#### Simulation
The application's internal modelling of a patients vitals and condition,
observable through the face monitor and vitals monitor.

#### Vital Monitor
One of three functionalities of the entire application. In this view a
participant is presented with the simulated patient's vitals. There is no direct
controls in this view; all updates are recieved remotely from the control
application.
